# NgDotnet

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.1.

The following command was used to create the project:

`ng new ng-dotnet -si --style=scss --routing=true && cd ng-dotnet`

## Additional Features Added on Top of the Angular CLI
- Addition of [ng-bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home)
- Added npm scripts that are useful for .NET Angular development
- Shared module for quicker, simpler development

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

If you're in a .NET environment, you'll need to have the files build and output everytime rather than storing them in memory. Run `npm run serve:dotnet` to build your files without file hashing and watch for changes in the /src directory.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. 

If you're building for production, run `npm run build:prod` instead. This will perform an optimized build that
